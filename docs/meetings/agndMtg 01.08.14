Meeting Notes
Clarification of Task/Project - Any task or project can be broken down. How is this going to affect the data that is stored for each node.

Glossary - Albert will merge to a proposal for the file (with Devins help) and push to Github.
Next document - we'll try word

Beth will add workflow column to timelog

Jared Spool - leave school 4:30 ish - leave car at mall

business cards - postpone until we have stuff in place.

Github profile - discussion about what potential employers would look at

Sprint planning - sprints start tuesday at meeting - end monday midnight

Testing - add a category to excel - walkthroughs are testing, testing is not a workflow
