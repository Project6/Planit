    Beth is going to go through to tutorial
    

The primary goal is to pull together the framework for our project.
This is my proposed sequence of actions:

using local host:
run a login page 
create a link that works
integrate a balsamiq mockup page (XML?)
create a login to write to a local database
be able to login using that created login
Do a live hosted test.

This is a "does it work" prototype.

And a framework that would give us some structure for incremental work.
