Meeting Notes
Extended discussion about version and document control. Agreed to use GITHub for working glossary of terms offline.
Agreed to define sprints as 1 week.
Agreed that the mockups should be just good enough to capture all the functional information needed.
Walk through Albert's Balsamiq mockups, comments below:
1/8 panel on left of tree (multiple) views is not a toggle, and the alternate view needs to be fleshed out
Outline view should have +/- for expand and contracting levels
Phase 2 - add a panel to allow user to customize/filter what/how they see the info 
Toggle On/Off color coding for school, work, personal
Top Ribbon changes
Phase 2 - more infor in explore area, sample project
Keep signup panel position consistent when go from home page to explore page
tree view - add up arrow
Phase 2 - zoom in, search box - think finding a house on a street in google maps when you kind of know where it is
schedule view - day, week, month
Are these next 2 items phase 2????????
1/8 panel add toggle button to minimize outline/task view 
schedule view docking of 1/8 panel
