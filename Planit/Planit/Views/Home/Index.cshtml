        <h3> Devin Gleason Lambert </h3>
        <p>
            I am a technologist at heart, a deep love for technology is how I got here. I have been dismantling hardware and fixing software since
            I was ten. I spent the last several years in Help desk related positions and decided I wanted something more challenging and left IT
            to move onto software. I have finished my computer science coursework and am now working on building a portfolio around the .NET
            framework and networking with other developers and am falling in love with the field all over again.

        <h3> Beth Van Belle </h3>
        
        <p>
            I look below the surface to understand how things work.  I am an experiential learner and typically find the 10 ways something won't work before I understand what does.  
            I came back to school to look at technology from a different perspective and wrestle with my thought process. And, I like chocolate birthday cake with ice cream.

        <h3> Alberto D Beltran </h3>
        <p>
            I have always been a technician that wondered how things worked, and why they worked that way.  Given enough time, I would take things apart to find out what made them tick.  
            It became a hobby and with time I became the "go to" person for anything technology.  I devoured anything and everything to do with technology.
            I came back to school to build on my foundation of "how things work" and how to make them better.
